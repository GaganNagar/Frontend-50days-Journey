# 🚀 My 50-Day Frontend Development Challenge  

Welcome to my **50-day frontend coding journey!**  
This repository is a daily log of my progress — where I’m building mini-projects, learning new frontend concepts, and improving my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills every single day.

## 🎯 About This Challenge  

The goal of this challenge is **consistency** — to code daily and strengthen frontend fundamentals through practical projects.  
Each day’s work is organized into a separate folder containing:  
- 📂 Project files (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- 🧠 Notes on key concepts learned that day

## 💻 Tech Stack  

- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
- **Core Concepts:** DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Form Validation, Regular Expressions (Regex), Arrays, Objects, Functions & Closures  
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub for version control
