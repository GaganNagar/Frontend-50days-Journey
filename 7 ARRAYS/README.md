# 7-ARRAYS — README

## Project Overview
This folder contains JavaScript exercises and practice projects focusing on **arrays**.  
The goal is to understand **array methods, manipulation, and iteration techniques**.

---

## Concepts Covered
- Array creation and initialization  
- Array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `push`, `pop`, `splice`  
- Spread operator and destructuring  
- Looping through arrays (`for`, `for-of`, `for-in`)  
- Practical exercises for problem-solving

## Code Snippets
```javascript
// Example: map & filter
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squared = numbers.map(num => num * num);
const even = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(squared); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
console.log(even);    // [2, 4]


Key Learnings / Skills Demonstrated
Practiced array manipulation and methods

Learned functional programming with map, filter, reduce

Gained confidence in looping and iterating arrays

Understood spread operator and destructuring

Future Improvements / Next Steps
Apply arrays in real-world projects

Combine arrays with objects and DOM manipulation

Optimize array operations for performance
